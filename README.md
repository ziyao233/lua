# Inline-cached Lua

This is a modified version of Lua which supports inline caching in table
searching. This is ***NOT*** a serious project and should not be used in
productions.

## Improvement

`BinaryTree.test.lua` and `BinaryTree.lua` are used for benchmarking.

Compiled with the same flags, both are run for 16 times and the average
consumed time is listed.
